## 👋 Hi, I’m Pierre

Product executive with a strong engineering background, specialised in **AI-native SaaS, enterprise platforms, and data products**.

I’ve spent the last 20 years building and scaling complex products at the intersection of **product strategy, platform architecture, and AI systems**.

### What I work on

* **AI-native product design** (LLMs, agentic workflows, human-in-the-loop systems)
* **Enterprise SaaS & PaaS platforms** (scale, governance, reliability)
* **Product strategy & execution** (North Star metrics, OKRs, evidence-based decisions)
* **Token economics & AI cost governance**
* **Bridging Product ↔ Engineering** (I still code when it matters)

### Things I’ve built

* Agentic AI workflows with auditability, guardrails, and deterministic fallbacks
* AI-driven data understanding & quality automation
* Multi-tenant SaaS platforms under extreme delivery constraints
* Usage-based and AI-driven pricing models
* Product operating models for regulated enterprise customers

### Tech & tools I’m comfortable with

`TypeScript` · `Python` · `React` · `Node.js` · `LLMs` · `Azure OpenAI` · `Kubernetes` · `CI/CD` · `SQL` · `Elastic` · `Neo4j`

### How I think

I treat **AI as a system, not a feature**.
Great products come from clarity of intent, strong guardrails, measurable outcomes, and tight collaboration between product, engineering, and business.
